this little extension runs a script of your choice and uses some data of the
current workout as arguments. I use it to tweet. with these settings:
script: /usr/bin/twidge
argument: upate

this runs twidge ( you have configure it first with "twidge update") with the
command "update" and a some data of your current workout:
title (if set)
distance
time
pace

Todo: I still need to find a way to make the arguments configurable.
But since this is my first shot, its enough :)
